Note that log-scale was used for the permeance. Carbon dioxide had the highest permeances, although H 2 is the smallest molecule. This is because CO 2 strongly absorbs on SAPO-17 crystals [17]. From CO 2 to C 3H8, the permeance significantly decreased with increasing molecular size, indicating that diffusivities of gas molecules decreased as their sizes approach the pore size of SAPO-17.

Silica supported SAPO-34 membranes for CO2 N2 separation.pdf,SAPO-34,SAPO-34 is potential membrane material for CO2/N2 separation.,9,2.01 �10�6 mol/m2 s Pa,It was demonstrated by single-gas permeation test that the SAPO-34-M2 membrane could surpass the Robeson plot (2008) for CO2/N2 separation (permeance ¼2.01 ( �10�6 mol/m2 s Pa; the highest selectivity ¼53).,9,The CO2/N2 selectivity for the given permeability reported in this study is 53.0,"It resulted in pure SAPO-34 and lower calcination temperature needed. XRF analysis of SAPO-34 membrane proves that the Si/Al ratio was about 0.49. With this composition, the membrane is expected to pose high CO2 adsorption capacity, pure SAPO-34 framework, and well-distributed Si content in the membrane structure. 3.3. CO2/N2 separation CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 selectivity of SAPO-34 membranes are depicted in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5 a and b, CO2 and N2 fluxes increase with increasing transmembrane pressure. It is obvious since higher pressure results in higher concentration difference between feed and permeate side leading to higher mass transfer or flux. An interesting result was observed in N2 flux of SAPO-34-M2 (shown in Fig. 5 b’). There are two regions in N2 flux vs trans-membrane pressure curve of SAPO- 34-M2. N2 flux is more pronounced in region II than in region I. It might imply that the concentration polarization occurred on the mem-concentration polarization on N2 permeation at higher pressure. The concentration polarization phenomenon resulted in a decrease of CO2/ N2 selectivity with increasing transmembrane pressure. It was demon - strated by single-gas permeation test that the SAPO-34-M2 membrane could surpass the Robeson plot (2008) for CO2/N2 separation (per- meance ¼2.01 ( �10�6 mol/m2 s Pa; the highest selectivity ¼53). The results showed that the prepared SAPO-34 membrane could be a po- tential alternative for CO2/N2 separation.",9

Qiao - 2012 PVAm PIP PS Composite Membrane with High Performance for CO2 N2 Separation.pdf,polymer of intrinsic porosity,"Merkel TC, Lin HQ, Wei XT, Baker R. Power plant post-combus-0.061305lmol/(m2s Pa).11However, commercially avail- able polymer membranes such as cellulose acetate, polysul- fone (PS), silicon rubbers, polyamides, and polyimides, which hardly have high CO 2permeance and CO 2/N2selec- tivity simultaneously, could not meet the requirement for CO 2capture. Recently, some ultrathin membranes showed an encouraging CO 2permeance more than 0.067lmol/(m2s Pa).13–17The membrane proposed by Merkel showed CO 2",9,"5.4 and 2.9 times of that of the PEO–PBT(PAN–PDMS) membrane at CO 2partial pressure of 0.09 and 0.3 MPa, respectively","From Table 2 and Figure 9, it can be deduced that the CO 2permeance of the PVAm–PIP/PSacomposite membrane is about 5.4 and 2.9 times of that of the PEO–PBT(PAN–PDMS) membrane at CO 2partial pressure of 0.09 and 0.3 MPa, respectively, and the corresponding CO 2/N2selectivity is about 2.1 and 1.2 times, respectively.",9,2.6 and 2.5 times,"The CO 2permeance of the PVAm–PIP/PSacomposite membrane is about 10.7 and 16.8 times of that of the PVAm–EDA/PS composite membrane mentioned above at 0.11 and 1.6 MPa, respectively, and the corresponding CO 2/N2selectivity is about 2.6 and 2.5 times, respectively.",9
